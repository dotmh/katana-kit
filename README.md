NODE NINJA
==========

Node Ninja is a set of standard libraries that can be used to build exciting Node apps. The eventually plan is for the 
libraries in Node Ninja to be split down in to smaller single function modules. This module will then therefore become
a wrapper/helper to include all of Node Ninja in to your application. 

Installing
----------

To install Node Ninja you will need NPM. 

```
npm install --save dotmh/node_ninja
```
